Hello, My name is HUANG Yiming, and you can also call me Claire.



Now I am currently a research master student at Nanjing University in China, with Organization Behavior and Strategy as my research field. And my supervisor is [Jiang Yan Jane](https://nubs.nju.edu.cn/jy/list.htm). And I am also familiar with some research tools and websites, such as SPSS, R, Qualtrics, etc.



With a passion for research, I keep being diligent and hard-working, and was fortunate enough to be sponsored to visiting at NTU in Singapore as a RA in 2020. During this time, I helped Assistant Professor [Fong Keng-Highberger](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=fongkeng) research leadership emergence and other projects of organizational behavior. 



In addition to my previous research experience, other areas that interest me stem from my goal of exploring the employees’ behaviors in multicultural context and the dark sides of characteristics and leaderships. Now I am participating in a project sponsored by B corps China and studying different institutions. And I also have some research ideas about the **female leader, dark sides of some employees’ behaviors and etc.**, and plan to study them in the future.
